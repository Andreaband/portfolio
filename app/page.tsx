          <p className="font-text text-center text-xl">Currently a Frontend Development student at a Yrkesh√∂gskolan (EC Utbildning) in Sweden, with graduation expected in 2026.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have a strong background as a Graphic Designer, gained through many years of experience working with advanced tools in the Adobe Suite, particularly Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my studies, I have expanded my technical skills to include Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and Express, which I currently master at a student level but am highly motivated to grow further.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am now looking for a company where I can complete my LIA (Internship) for six months starting in November, applying my knowledge and developing new competencies.

          <h2 className="font-title text-center text-4xl">More about me</h2>
          <p className="font-text text-xl">I am currently a student in Frontend Development at a Yrkesh√∂gskolan (EC Utbildning) in Sweden, with graduation expected in 2026.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before pursuing my studies in Frontend Development, I worked as a Graphic Designer for several years, developing strong expertise in the Adobe Suite, particularly Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. This extensive experience has given me a solid foundation in design principles, visual communication, and attention to detail. I now bring this creativity and precision into my frontend development journey, where I have expanded my skills to include Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and Express.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my studies, I have worked on various projects that have allowed me to build responsive web applications and improve my problem-solving skills. Although my current technical skills are at a student level, I am highly motivated to grow and apply my combined background in graphic design and frontend development to create visually appealing and user-friendly solutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team while gaining hands-on experience and advancing my career in web development.
